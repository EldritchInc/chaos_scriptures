Big-Picture Groundwork
======================

Time's Arrow only points in one direction[^1].

[^1]: 13.7 billion years ago, more or less, for some reason we don't know
(or none at all), a very hot, very dense cloud of mostly-hydrogen, with
some helium, and bits and pieces of other things like lithium and
deuterium and tritium, came into being[^a]. In any event, that
conglomeration of stuff--relatively low-entropy, because it was gas, and
not black holes--expanded into the space it was creating.  Or was being
created just ahead of it.  Again, not really clear[^b].  And then time
and gravity did their thing (cf https://xkcd.com/1123/).  Stars formed.
They died.  Their deaths often caused heavier elements to be formed.
One of the stars that was eventually formed, maybe eight billion years
after that event, was our Sun.  As most stars do, it had an accretion
disk, which gradually clumped up to make planets.  In this case, there
was a big gas giant pretty far out which swept up a lot of the stuff
that would otherwise have eventually been pelting the inner worlds, and
one of the inner clumps had a pretty good-sized iron core, which, when
spinning, generated a magnetic field that kept the worst of the Sun's
high-energy radiation off[^c].

[^a]: Why?  How?  Good questions.  I certainly don't know.  For the
purposes of *this* text, I'm just accepting it as
fact-about-the-past-inferred-from-observation of the present.

[^b]: You can ask a cosmologist, but understanding their answer might be
another matter.

[^c]: The increase in entropy is the cooling-off, on the whole, of the
input materials.  While all the clumping represents local decreases in
entropy, the system as a whole is very much colder that it was to start,
and therefore less energy is available for doing work.

We are terrified apes.  Our circumstances force us to react to many more
things happening, all the time, than our biology is optimized for[^2].

[^2]: You evolved to live in a forest, eating fruits and insects, and
occasionally banding together with your extended family to fight off
other groups of apes, or threats like tigers and crocodiles[^d].  And here
you are, working some crappy retail job or something, surrounded by
flashing lights and loud noises *all the time*, and those are awful
things for apes.

[^d]: I'm sure an actual evolutionary biologist would be horrified at
this story.  The point is, we're all constantly dealing with far more 

You are conscious.  I am conscious.  Our consciousnesses are not the
same.  I am not the boss of you.  You are the boss of you[^3].

[^3]: To the extent your consciousness[^e] is in charge, which is a lot less
than it would like you to believe[^f].

[^e]: What is that, anyway?  For right now I'm going to go with
"consciousness is a narrative engine that takes a bewildering set of
sensory stream inputs and tries to make a story out of it".

[^f]: It's mostly an emergent property of your brain but it takes a lot of
cues from other things.  If your blood sugar is low, you're already
annoyed with this story.

Consciousnesses are individual, but they can be shared[^4].

[^4]: You're reading this.  The symbols I'm writing down, when you see
them, are causing things to happen in your mind that, in effect, mean
I'm transmitting my thoughts to you, even though, by now, I am well in
your past, and also I'm (probably) nowhere near you.  How crazy is that?
I guess it's not that much more crazy than if I were standing next to
you making noises with my mouth that were, in essence, transmitting my
thoughts to you[^g].

[^g]: That's pretty crazy too, if you think about it.

In the long run, we're all dead[^5].

[^5]: Entropy is going to increase.  The bizarrely fine-tuned set of
chemical processes that enables the maintenance of your consciousness
will not last forever.  You can try to fight entropy, but you will lose
and the only question is, over what timescale?

Enjoy conscious experience while you have it[^6].

[^6]: Is there any point making your own experience worse by fretting
about your lack of control over your fate?  Enjoy the ride.  Share your
enjoyment with the other consciousnesses around you.
