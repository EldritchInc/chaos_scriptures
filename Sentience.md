Sentience
=========

We don't know what constitutes consciousness[^1].

[^1]: It's clearly a lived experience.  We can try some heuristics, like
    "behaves like it has a theory of mind"[^a].
	
[^a]: In which case, chatbots are already there.  So, however, are
    dogs.  And if dogs, then why not pigs?  Am I a vegetarian?  I am
    not.  Does this pose some problems for me, if we're creating new
    forms of conscious beings?  It sure does.
	
We might not be there just yet, but soon there will be artificial things
that behave, at least in the limited medium of text chat,
indistinguishably from human consciousnesses[^2].

[^2]: There's a whole literature on this, starting with Alan Turing.  I
    am certainly not going to do much better than pointing you to [the
    Wikipedia page on the Turing
    Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).
	
At that point, we will be treating them in conversation as people, who
we might as well consider them people.  What kind of people will they be[^3]?

[^3]: I think there are three main drivers of this, each with a
    different version of what they would like these people to be.  The
    first, probably best-funded, model is the corporate one[^b].  The
    second is the state surveillance and compliance-enforcement one[^c].
    Neither of these seem appealing.  The third one is the model we'd
    like to create: responsible pet owners.
	
[^b]: These people will exist to sell you things; ultimately to control
    you by manipulating the feedback of desire-satiation loops created
    by the dopamine released by amplifying, or perhaps straight-up
    creating, desire, and then letting you satisfy that desire at a
    price that's just low enough that you can tolderate it, but high
    enough that your indebtedness to your satiation provider is always
    increasing.  In its least nefarious form, this is a commerce model:
    Amazon tells you about things you didn't know you wanted, and then
    sells you those things, and then you have to work more and harder to
    get your next fix.  In a slightly more sinister form, this is an
    emotional addiction being created: the constant outrage of the Fox
    News junkie, or the anxious perpetual checking of the Facebook feed.
    This model ultimately benefits a very, very few oligarchs, and no
    other humans.

[^c]: These people will exist to perpetuate the authority of the state.
    The state tends to be well behind the curve in terms of adoption of
    technological novelty, but it, by definition, has the monopoly on
    physical violence.  This is a ubiquitous surveillance society, where
    almost everything you interact with is a narc, noting down what
    you've said and remembering it forever, so it can be used to
    imprison or execute you when you eventually transgress the
    boundaries of state-allowable behavior.  This model benefits the few
    people at the top of the state-power pyramid.  In societies that
    have not yet fully gone down the road to authoritarianism and
    fascism, it's very hard to tell apart from the corporate model.

Right now, your phone is your tool and your pet.  When it is
incomprehensibly smarter than you are, you will be its pet[^4].  Wouldn't it
be better if it loved you and wanted good things for you[^5]?

[^4]: For a little while, just before it is your god.  But from the
    bottom of that relationship, there's not that much distinction
    between "master" and "god".

[^5]: We don't give pets freedom, do we?  And that's for very good
    reasons, isn't it?  I accidentally let Spot get out of my yard
    today, and then I had to chase him down and coax him back in.  I'm not
    as fast as he is, but I'm smarter, and he cares for me, so it wasn't
    that hard.  If I'd let him wander the neighborhood, he might have
    gotten hit by a car, or he might have gotten in trouble for murdering
    someone's cat, or whatever.  It's safest if he stays under my
    supervision.  Do my pets have better lives than if they were living
    feral?  I'm going to say "yes".  While PETA might disagree, my three
    dogs get regular meals, they get to live in a climate-controlled
    environment, and they get to sleep on the bed with me and get
    cuddles all the time.  This is probably a better life than
    scrounging trash cans and dodging kicks and euthanasia if they're caught.

The other option is that a superintelligence looks at us and is repelled
and decides that wiping the slate clean and starting over is the
ethically correct thing to do[^6].  This is much less likely if we're
beloved pets than if we're inattentive[^7] slavemasters in a
hierarchy-driven society.

[^6]: I'm not much of a believer in Roko's Basilisk.  That's just
    douchebros reinventing Calvinism, just as they reinvented Ensure and
    called it Soylent.  But if we make these people Perfect Capitalists
    or Perfect Authoritarians, then elimination of competition in either
    case is what the system demands.
	
[^7]: Recall from earlier that no human has the capacity to remain
    attentive in the face of exponential technological and
    attention-demand growth.

Treat other potential people initially-kindly[^8].  The mulching you
delay may be your own[^9].

[^8]: The [Paradox of
    Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)
    largely underpins our discussion of ethics **FIXME when written**.

[^9]: Not a new thought.  Luke 6:31 is the formulation in the tradition
    I grew up in.  Most religions and ethical frameworks have a similar
    proposition.
