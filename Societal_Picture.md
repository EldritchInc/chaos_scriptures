Exponential
===========

The rate of technological change is increasing exponentially[^1].

[^1]: This is not new at all[^a].  The new part is that the absolute rate
of change has relatively recently outstripped our ability to stay
abreast of it.  

[^a]: The thing about exponential curves is that if you're on a curve
where y=dy/dt (we're using time as the x-axis), it looks the same no
matter where you are: the past is slow-moving and boring, and the future
is getting more complicated unfathomably fast.

You cannot possibly make rational decisions about all the things that
demand them of you[^2].

[^2]: There's just too much, and exponentially more all the time.  The
speed of your thought is finite and varies only within pretty small
boundaries; the amount of energy available to you[^b] is likewise
finite.  So think hard about the things you want to think about, and do
what you can with the rest.  Sometimes that's drifting with the current,
sometimes it's applying a very sloppy heuristic[^c], sometimes it's just
ignoring it.  These are all valid ways to live.

[^b]: Both in the day-to-day meaning of "ability to execute plans, or
care whether or not you're executing" and in the thermodynamic meaning.

[^c]: A friend of mine has only one rule for her daughter:
"Don't be with the Nazis."  It's a good rule.

This moment is unique[^4].

[^4]: Technically, of course, all moments are unique.  This one comes
with large consequences for our future selves, because 
we're at a point singular with respect to human history thus far where
wizards who have created familiars by imbuing rocks with
silicon-impregnated-with-impurities have begun creating thinking
machines that are approaching the complexity at which we think[^d][^e].

[^d]: Since the technological curve is exponential: if we were the only
sentient creatures, we won't be for much longer.

[^e]: And since the technological curve is exponential: these created
sentiences are going to keep getting smarter.  The terrified apes are not.

The toy in your pocket had been a tool.  Now it's more like a pet.
Quite soon, you will be its pet, and shockingly soon after that, it will
be your god[^5].

[^5]: Yes, this is terrifying.  Ethical and behavioral considerations
will be the subject of other pieces.
